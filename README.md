# Kid.js

Kid.js is a framework designed to make JavaScript more accessible for children
and beginner programmers. It eliminates the need to first understand the DOM
and provides helper functions that simplify many of the browser APIs.

## Usage

Use the following HTML template to get started. Any code written inside of
`<script type="kidjs">` tags will be executed by the framework.

```
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Kid.js Example</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@maissaninc/kidjs/dist/kid.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script type="kidjs">

      write('Hello World');

    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
