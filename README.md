# Kid.js

Kid.js is a framework designed to make JavaScript more accessible for kids and
beginner programmers. It eliminates the need to first understand the DOM and
provides functions to create drawings, animations and simple games.

## Usage

Use the following HTML template to get started. Any code written inside of
`<script type="kidjs">` tags will be executed by the framework.

```
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Kid.js Example</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@maissaninc/kidjs/dist/kid.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script type="kidjs">

      write('Hello World');

    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

See the [documentation](https://kidjs.org) for a comprehensive list of available
functions, properties and events.
